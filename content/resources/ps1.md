description: Problem set on making intuitive judgments about probabilities in certain
  kinds of situations, the computation of some probabilities as a function of judgments
  about others, reflection on what one is doing when one makes such intuitive judgments,
  and the status of the theoretical assumptions presupposed in the computations.
